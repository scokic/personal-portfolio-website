# Strahinja's website


Hello! This is my personal portfolio [website](https://scokic.github.io/personal-portfolio-website/).

I'm an IT project manager which is transitioning into frontend development. I wanted to create a hub that will help me showcase my learnings through projects I've built.

So far I've mostly learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so website has been built from scratch without any library.

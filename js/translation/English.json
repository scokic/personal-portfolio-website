In the meantime I've been trying out a bunch of organizational methodologies and apps. That's when I've figured out that I love software and that I've enjoyed more and more in great made apps with day by day. At some point I've asked myself: Why wouldn't I be the guy that's making great apps? That's when I've realized that development is for me.
